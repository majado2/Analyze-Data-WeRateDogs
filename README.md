**Data Wrangling summary**
In this analysis, I checked the data from the missing values and also made sure of the correct data type. I also corrected some ages that were written incorrectly to the closest logical result option, and also I dropped all rows that do not contain a specification for the user type or the gender of the user because it is essential to our research. I added a column For the age calculated from the date of birth. I also added a column for the day the trip started in a week calculated from the date the trip started. I also added a column for the duration of the trip in minutes calculated from the duration of the trip in seconds.



## Summary of Findings

> It started with three tables, the first for tweet information, the second for the machine's analysis of dog
photos, and the third for total likes and retweets.\
You clean the data and group it together In view of the available data, we find a lot of loss and inaccuracy. It
is really difficult to give judgments based on the types of dogs or the rate of dogs, and this is what took me
to another direction, which is the interaction of users with the type of tweet, and what is the most\
interaction, is it likes or retweets, and indeed I find that likes are more than retweets Also, it appears to me
through the results that the tweets that contain a video have more interaction than the tweets that have
pictures only

## Note 


We took a sample of the image analysis by machine learning and unfortunately 3
different and incorrect possibilities We also took a sample of the negative possibilities, and
indeed a picture of a dog appeared For these reasons, machine learning may not have
sufficient accuracy to identify the dog species I checked the names of the dogs, and they do
not necessarily mean the type of dog, just names that were named by the owners of the dogs
We cannot judge the data provided to us by the most popular or most rated dogs, which is
one of the reasons for the research
Conclusion The average engagement with tweets that contain videos is more than the
average for tweets that contain images only
